-CartItems should have cart Ids separate from 
id of the item. Current problem is that duplicates all delete
(unless I do by quanity which makes more sense)

-with quantity be able to have flexibility to select exactly how much to add/delete
-make the searchbar grey out the other items instead of hiding them
-fix the image delete bug (if the image was deleted, and it's browsed again,
it will not put it up)
